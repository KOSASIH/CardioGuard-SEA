### Project Overview

CardioGuard SEA is a wearable device and mobile application designed to monitor and predict the risk of cardiovascular diseases. The device collects physiological data from the user, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation, and sends it to the mobile application for analysis. The mobile application uses machine learning models to analyze the data and predict the user's risk of cardiovascular diseases. The project includes the following modules:

1. Backend Server: A RESTful API server built using Node.js and Express.js. It provides endpoints for the mobile application to send and receive data from the wearable device.
2. Machine Learning Models: Pre-trained machine learning models built using TensorFlow and Keras. The models are used to analyze the physiological data and predict the user's risk of cardiovascular diseases.
3. Mobile Application: A cross-platform mobile application built using React Native and Expo. It provides a user interface for the user to view their physiological data and receive notifications about their risk of cardiovascular diseases.
4. Wearable Device Firmware: Firmware for the wearable device built using C and the STM32CubeIDE. It provides the device's firmware and communication protocols for sending and receiving data from the mobile application.

### Project Structure
